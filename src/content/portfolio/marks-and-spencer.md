challenge: "Marks & Spencer needed to modernize enterprise commerce across multiple portfolios while maintaining delivery velocity and reliability at scale. Key challenges included improving frontend performance and developer experience, enabling faster experimentation and feature releases, strengthening observability and platform tooling, and reducing operational cost without compromising customer experience."
solution: "Protize led an enterprise modernization program covering architecture, platform capabilities, and engineering practices. We upgraded frontend foundations (React/Next.js/TypeScript), improved API and integration strategy (GraphQL + Mesh), strengthened CI/CD and quality engineering (Playwright/Jest), enabled safe experimentation (LaunchDarkly), and improved observability (New Relic). Infrastructure and delivery improvements were supported through Terraform, Azure-based platform work, and collaboration across agile teams with hiring enablement."
