## Overview

Protize worked with Marks & Spencer to drive enterprise-wide technology modernization across multiple portfolios. The engagement focused on upgrading architecture, improving delivery velocity, and enabling a scalable, experimentation-ready digital platform.

## Business Context

M&S is one of the largest retailers in the UK, operating at high digital traffic scale with complex multi-team engineering workflows. The platform needed modernization to improve customer experience, release confidence, and operational efficiency.

## Challenge

Marks & Spencer needed to modernize enterprise commerce across multiple portfolios while maintaining delivery velocity and reliability at scale. Key challenges included improving frontend performance and developer experience, enabling faster experimentation and feature releases, strengthening observability and platform tooling, and reducing operational cost without compromising customer experience.

## Solution

Protize led an enterprise modernization program covering architecture, platform capabilities, and engineering practices. We upgraded frontend foundations (React/Next.js/TypeScript), improved API and integration strategy (GraphQL + Mesh), strengthened CI/CD and quality engineering (Playwright/Jest), enabled safe experimentation (LaunchDarkly), and improved observability (New Relic). Infrastructure and delivery improvements were supported through Terraform, Azure-based platform work, and collaboration across agile teams with hiring enablement.

## What We Delivered

- Modern frontend architecture aligned for enterprise-scale rollout
- Improved API integration strategy using GraphQL + Mesh
- Edge-function oriented delivery approach for performance and cost control
- Platform standards for experimentation, analytics, caching, and CMS integration
- Test automation and release hardening with Playwright + Jest + CI/CD
- Observability and controlled rollout foundations via New Relic and LaunchDarkly
- Cross-portfolio engineering collaboration, coaching, and hiring enablement
