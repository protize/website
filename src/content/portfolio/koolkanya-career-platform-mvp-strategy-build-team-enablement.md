## Engagement Period
Aug 2018 – Jan 2019

## Overview
Protize collaborated closely with the founder to shape KoolKanya’s technology vision and deliver the beta product from idea stage.  
The engagement covered product discovery, architecture planning, outsourced team governance, and end-to-end tech hiring support.

## Business Context
KoolKanya needed to move quickly from concept to a usable product while balancing speed, quality, and scalability.  
The goal was to validate user demand early and launch an extensible foundation for future growth.

## Challenges

- Product discovery and requirement scoping
- Prototype planning and design sprint facilitation
- Engineering architecture direction for scalable MVP
- Outsourced team management and quality governance
- Tech recruitment support: JD creation, sourcing, interviewing, offer negotiation

## Technology Stack
React, Node.js, Microservices, CI/CD, AWS

## What We Delivered
- Low-fidelity prototypes and structured design sprint outputs
- Prioritized product scope for faster, lower-risk MVP execution
- Managed outsourced team of 10 engineers with delivery controls
- Established code quality and scalable architecture guidelines
- Supported end-to-end recruitment processes for tech roles
- Iterative launch process based on user testing and feedback loops

## Outcomes
- Product discovery and scoping approach saved **~6 months** of development time
