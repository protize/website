## Overview

Protize partnered closely with KoolKanya from the idea stage to shape technology vision, define MVP strategy, and execute a beta launch path. The engagement combined product discovery, architecture direction, delivery governance, and hiring enablement to create a foundation for scale.

## Business Context

KoolKanya needed to validate user demand quickly while balancing speed, quality, and long-term scalability. The business required a practical approach to move from concept to market with clear scope, disciplined execution, and a team model that could grow post-launch.

## Challenge

The initiative began without an existing production system, requiring rapid MVP definition under early-stage constraints. Key challenges included managing outsourced engineering quality, preventing scope drift, and setting up a sustainable hiring pipeline for future scaling.

## Solution

Protize drove sprint-led product discovery, translated insights into a prioritized MVP roadmap, and guided implementation on scalable architecture patterns. In parallel, we established CI/CD and quality controls, managed outsourced delivery rigor, and supported end-to-end recruitment and team onboarding.

## What We Delivered

- Low-fidelity prototypes and structured design sprint outputs
- Prioritized MVP scope for faster, lower-risk execution
- Governance model for outsourced engineering delivery quality
- Scalable architecture and code quality guidelines
- CI/CD foundations for reliable iteration and release confidence
- End-to-end hiring support across role definition, interviews, and onboarding
