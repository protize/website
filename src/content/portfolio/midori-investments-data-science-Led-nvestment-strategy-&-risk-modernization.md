challenge: "Midori Investments needed to build a data science capability for investment research and portfolio strategy while strengthening IT risk controls. The challenge included designing repeatable research workflows, enabling data-driven asset allocation and portfolio review, and implementing secure engineering foundations (access control, encrypted storage, and protected development workflows) suitable for finance-grade risk and compliance expectations."
solution: "Protize helped establish and scale the data science function by building research pipelines and investment models using Python and Node.js, enabling portfolio review and asset allocation analysis. Alongside analytics, we modernized risk and security controls—introducing secure development practices, encrypted data storage, VPN access patterns, and a self-hosted Git setup. The program was delivered on Azure with an emphasis on reliability, auditability, and secure collaboration."
