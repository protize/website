## Overview

Protize established and led a dedicated data science function for Midori Investments to accelerate research quality, portfolio strategy, and decision velocity. The engagement combined analytics modernization with strong IT risk controls to support secure, data-driven investment operations.

## Business Context

Midori required a robust analytics-led framework for evaluating multi-asset opportunities across stocks, securities, and derivatives. At the same time, the firm needed stronger security and governance controls for proprietary research data, models, and development workflows.

## Challenge

The organization needed structured and repeatable processes for investment research, portfolio review, and allocation strategy. Existing risk readiness and security posture also required modernization to meet finance-grade expectations for confidentiality, control, and operational assurance.

## Solution

Protize designed a scalable operating model for research and portfolio analytics, including model-driven evaluation and quarterly review workflows. We also strengthened infrastructure and process controls through encrypted storage, secure developer access via VPN, and self-hosted source control governance on Azure-backed environments.

## What We Delivered

- Data science operating model for investment research and analysis
- Proprietary models for asset allocation and return optimization
- Quarterly portfolio review and rebalance decision framework
