## Overview

Protize worked with Hubble across architecture modernization, feature delivery, refactoring, search acceleration, and engineering enablement. The engagement focused on improving speed, reliability, and maintainability while supporting business growth through stronger product and sales workflows.

## Business Context

As Hubble scaled, delivery velocity and platform reliability became critical to revenue execution. The company needed to reduce technical debt, improve core customer-facing performance (especially search), and establish engineering practices that could sustain faster, higher-quality releases.

## Challenge

Hubble faced monolithic constraints, growing technical debt, and uneven engineering practices that slowed iteration. Search and sales workflows needed significant performance and reliability improvements, while release processes required stronger automation and quality controls.

## Solution

Protize led a modernization program spanning service decoupling, microservices direction, CI/CD implementation, and codebase hardening. We improved real-time search performance using Elasticsearch, supported lead/sales workflow automation, and embedded quality practices through pair programming, code reviews, engineering standards, and hiring support.

## What We Delivered

- Monolith decomposition direction with microservice-oriented architecture
- CI/CD pipelines for faster and more stable releases
- Service decoupling to support event-sourcing-aligned evolution
- Real-time search engine improvements with Elasticsearch
- Microservices for lead tracking and sales workflow automation
- Engineering quality rituals: code reviews, pairing, and development guidelines
