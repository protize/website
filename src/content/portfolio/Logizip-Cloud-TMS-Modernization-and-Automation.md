## Overview

Protize partnered with Logizip LLC to modernize logistics operations through a cloud-based Trucking Management System (TMS). The engagement combined architecture leadership, full-stack product development, intelligent automation, and deep third-party integrations to improve execution speed and operational control.

## Business Context

Logizip required a robust digital foundation to streamline dispatch, order handling, and fleet workflows across growing operational demands. The business needed a scalable platform that could unify systems, reduce manual overhead, and support secure, real-time decision-making.

## Challenge

Legacy and fragmented processes created inefficiencies across trucking operations, while external dependencies required reliable integration with logistics, mapping, and compliance tools. The platform had to support high-throughput operations across web and mobile without disrupting existing workflows.

## Solution

Protize implemented a cloud-first TMS architecture with modular services and integration-ready APIs. We delivered automation pipelines using Python and OpenAI-assisted workflows, connected ecosystem services including BorderConnect, GoMotive, and Trimble Maps, and strengthened identity/security through Google OAuth2 and controlled communication automation via WhatsApp.

## What We Delivered

- Cloud-based Trucking Management System with scalable architecture
- Full-stack web/mobile capabilities for dispatch and operations workflows
- Integration of ecosystem services:
  - BorderConnect
  - GoMotive
  - Trimble Maps
  - Google OAuth2
- OpenAI + WhatsApp-enabled automation for order processing and communication
- Security, extensibility, and operational visibility improvements for day-to-day execution
