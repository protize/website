challenge: "Logizip needed to modernize trucking operations with a cloud-first TMS that could scale across web and mobile, integrate key logistics partners (tracking, maps, compliance), and reduce manual work. The challenge included building reliable automation flows, integrating multiple third-party systems, and improving operational speed without disrupting daily fleet workflows."
solution: "Protize delivered a cloud-based TMS modernization program with a scalable architecture (React + NestJS + GraphQL + PostgreSQL). We implemented operational automations and intelligent workflows using Python services and OpenAI-assisted automation, plus deep integrations including WhatsApp notifications, Google OAuth2, BorderConnect, GoMotive, and Trimble Maps. We also supported team management and delivery processes to scale output predictably."
