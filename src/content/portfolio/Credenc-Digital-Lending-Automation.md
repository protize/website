challenge: "Credenc needed to scale lending operations with faster turnaround times and fewer manual steps. The key challenge was building reliable automated loan approval workflows, integrating external credit scoring (CRIF), and enabling secure digital onboarding with KYC and e-sign/e-mandate flows—while keeping the system stable under increasing application volume."
solution: "Protize delivered an end-to-end automation program: streamlined digital onboarding, integrated CRIF-based credit scoring, implemented an approval workflow/decision engine, and connected digital compliance flows (KYC, e-sign, e-mandate/e-NACH) via third-party providers such as Digio. The solution included API-led architecture across services, operational monitoring, and scalable deployment on AWS."
