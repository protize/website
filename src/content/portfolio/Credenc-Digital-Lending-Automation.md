## Overview

Protize partnered with Credenc to modernize lending operations through workflow automation, faster decisioning, and seamless digital onboarding. The engagement focused on reducing manual effort, improving turnaround time, and building a scalable foundation for growth.

## Business Context

Credenc needed reliable, high-throughput processing across loan approvals, compliance, and mandate flows. As application volumes increased, the business required stronger underwriting consistency, better conversion from onboarding journeys, and tighter integration with external ecosystems.

## Challenge

Manual-heavy approval and onboarding steps were slowing operations and introducing inconsistency. Credenc needed integrated credit scoring, secure digital compliance journeys, and a stable API-first system that could handle higher demand without compromising control or customer experience.

## Solution

Protize implemented a lending automation stack centered on a configurable approval engine, CRIF-integrated credit scoring, and fully digitized onboarding flows. We connected KYC, e-sign, e-mandate, and e-NACH workflows via Digio integrations, and improved operational reliability through service-oriented architecture and cloud-native deployment on AWS.

## What We Delivered

- Automated Loan Approval Engine for faster and more consistent decisions
- CRIF scoring integration embedded into underwriting workflow
- End-to-end digital onboarding automation with Digio integrations:
  - KYC
