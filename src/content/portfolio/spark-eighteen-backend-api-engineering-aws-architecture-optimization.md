## Overview

Protize partnered with Spark Eighteen to strengthen backend platform delivery across multiple projects through API-first engineering, integration enablement, and cloud architecture optimization. The engagement focused on shipping reliable backend foundations that could scale with fast-moving product demands.

## Business Context

Spark Eighteen required maintainable backend systems for integration-heavy digital products, including content-driven APIs, payment workflows, and data ingestion pipelines. The business needed faster execution with consistent reliability across parallel project tracks.

## Challenge

The organization needed robust and reusable API architecture across varied product requirements while maintaining delivery speed. Key constraints included CMS/API integration needs, third-party payment/data workflows, and cloud efficiency improvements on AWS.

## Solution

Protize standardized backend service development on Node.js/Express with clear API patterns, persistent data models, and deployment discipline. We integrated Strapi for content operations, implemented Razorpay payment integrations, enabled crawling-based ingestion workflows, and refined AWS infrastructure for better scalability and cost-aware operations.

## What We Delivered

- Backend REST APIs across multiple projects, including:
  - Zorbs (UNICEF)
  - Good Living
- Strapi integration for faster content-to-API workflow delivery
- AWS architecture refinements for scalability and operational reliability
- Razorpay integration for transaction-enabled backend use cases
- Data ingestion support, including web crawling pipeline scenarios
- Standardized backend architecture patterns for maintainability and extension

## Technology Stack
