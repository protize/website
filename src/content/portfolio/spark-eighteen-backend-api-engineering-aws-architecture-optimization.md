challenge: "Spark Eighteen needed reliable, scalable backend systems across multiple projects—covering API development, content workflows, and third-party integrations—while also improving AWS infrastructure efficiency. The challenge was to move fast across parallel deliveries without sacrificing stability, security, or operational cost control."
solution: "Protize built and optimized backend services using Node.js/Express with well-structured REST APIs and MySQL persistence. We integrated Strapi to streamline content publishing workflows and implemented automation for data ingestion (web crawling) and payments (Razorpay). In parallel, we reviewed and optimized AWS architecture to improve reliability and reduce infrastructure overhead across multi-project deployments."

- Strapi integration for API-centric content/data workflows
- AWS architecture optimization and deployment support
- Razorpay integration for payment processing use cases
- Web crawling pipeline support for data collection scenarios
- Database-driven service implementation and backend architecture strengthening

## Technology Stack

Node.js, Express.js, AWS, Strapi, MySQL, Web Crawling Tools, Razorpay APIs

## What We Delivered

- Implemented backend REST APIs for projects including:
  - Zorbs (UNICEF)
  - Good Living
- Integrated Strapi to accelerate API development and content-driven endpoints
- Improved AWS deployment architecture for better scalability and operational efficiency
- Implemented Razorpay integration flows for transaction enablement
- Built/support data ingestion workflows (including web crawling use cases)
- Standardized backend architecture patterns for easier project extension and maintenance

## Outcomes

- Faster backend delivery cycles through reusable API architecture
- Improved system stability and maintainability across projects
