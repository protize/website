- Integration requirements for CMS-driven API delivery
- Requirement to improve cloud architecture efficiency on AWS
- Support for payment and data ingestion workflows
- Ensuring delivery speed without compromising backend reliability

## Protize Scope
- Backend REST API design and implementation for multiple products
- Strapi integration for API-centric content/data workflows
- AWS architecture optimization and deployment support
- Razorpay integration for payment processing use cases
- Web crawling pipeline support for data collection scenarios
- Database-driven service implementation and backend architecture strengthening

## Technology Stack
Node.js, Express.js, AWS, Strapi, MySQL, Web Crawling Tools, Razorpay APIs

## What We Delivered
- Implemented backend REST APIs for projects including:
  - Zorbs (UNICEF)
  - Good Living
- Integrated Strapi to accelerate API development and content-driven endpoints
- Improved AWS deployment architecture for better scalability and operational efficiency
- Implemented Razorpay integration flows for transaction enablement
- Built/support data ingestion workflows (including web crawling use cases)
- Standardized backend architecture patterns for easier project extension and maintenance

## Outcomes
- Faster backend delivery cycles through reusable API architecture
- Improved system stability and maintainability across projects
- Streamlined CMS/API operations using Strapi
- Better cloud utilization through AWS architecture refinements
- Stronger integration ecosystem for payments and external data workflows
