## Overview

Protize collaborated with Zoopla on large-scale engineering transformation across multiple products and teams. The engagement focused on platform modernization, delivery acceleration, software quality, observability, and security readiness for a property ecosystem serving millions of users.

## Business Context

Zoopla operates one of the UK's largest property platforms, with high traffic, rapid release cycles, and strict reliability expectations. Sustained growth required stronger engineering standards, better quality governance, improved monitoring, and modern cloud delivery practices.

## Challenge

Legacy patterns and inconsistent delivery practices across teams were affecting speed and release confidence. Zoopla needed stronger automation, safer experimentation, and tighter security and infrastructure controls to improve performance and reliability at enterprise scale.

## Solution

Protize introduced a modernization roadmap covering architecture, delivery processes, and engineering quality. We improved core platform foundations, established stronger CI/CD and automated testing workflows, enabled structured A/B experimentation, and implemented observability and security practices to support stable and data-informed releases.

## What We Delivered

- Architecture modernization strategy and multi-team execution roadmap
- Agile delivery model improvements to increase engineering throughput
- Multi-layer QA automation and structured error reporting discipline
- Observability implementation for service health and incident visibility
- Security and threat-risk evaluation for infrastructure and release workflows
- A/B testing standards for experimentation and UX optimization
- Mentorship and onboarding acceleration for engineering capability growth
