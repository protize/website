## Client

Zoopla (UK Property Portal)

## Engagement Period

Aug 2019 – Sep 2021

## Overview

Protize collaborated with Zoopla to guide large-scale engineering transformation across multiple products and teams.  
The engagement focused on architecture modernization, delivery acceleration, software quality, security readiness, and operational reliability for a platform serving millions of users.

## Business Context

Zoopla is one of the largest property portals in the UK with high user traffic, fast release expectations, and strict reliability requirements.  
The platform needed stronger engineering standards, better testing discipline, improved observability, and modern infrastructure practices to sustain rapid growth.

## Challenges

- Legacy engineering patterns slowing down delivery
- Inconsistent practices across multiple teams and projects
- Need for stronger quality gates and faster release confidence
- Security and infrastructure risk exposure at scale
- Requirement to improve uptime, experimentation, and conversion outcomes

## Protize Scope

- Coaching and agile transformation across engineering functions
- Hiring support and capability development
- Architecture strategy and modernization planning
- QA strategy, automation standards, and release governance
- Observability, security risk evaluation, and experimentation frameworks
- Mentorship programs for junior and mid-level engineers

## Technology Stack

React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Next.js, Serverless, Terraform, CloudFront, Docker, CI/CD, Apache Spark, Cypress, Jest, FastAPI, AWS

## What We Delivered

- New architecture strategy and modernization roadmap
- Agile operating model to improve engineering throughput
- Multi-layer testing suites and structured error reporting setup
- Threat-risk model evaluation for infrastructure and release readiness
- Observability implementation to improve service health monitoring
- A/B testing standards for product experimentation and UX optimization
- Structured mentorship and onboarding acceleration programs

## Outcomes

- Software delivery lifecycle improved by **~70%**
- More than **$1M** in opportunity cost saved via quality and stability initiatives
- Reliability improvements targeting **~99% uptime**
- Better experimentation culture and measurable conversion improvements
- Some pages achieved **~2x increase in leads**
