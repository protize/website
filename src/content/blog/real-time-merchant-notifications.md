In today's fast-moving digital payment landscape, **real-time merchant notifications** are no longer optional — they’re essential.  
At Protize, we implemented **Telegram-based alerts** to notify merchants instantly about **wallet updates**, **payment failures**, and **server downtime** — helping businesses react faster and maintain operational continuity.

## 🚀 Why Real-Time Notifications Matter

Merchants handle thousands of transactions daily. Without timely alerts, critical issues — such as low wallet balances or server failures — can go unnoticed until it’s too late. <br/>

### Key Benefits

- **Prevent Transaction Failures:** Automatic alerts when the wallet balance drops below a set limit.  
- **Faster Issue Resolution:** Notify merchants immediately about failed payments or downtime.  
- **Transparency & Trust:** Keep merchants informed 24/7 — improving confidence in the system.

Real-time alerts bridge the gap between **backend systems** and **merchant actions**, ensuring smooth payment flow even during peak load.

## 💬 Why We Chose Telegram

We wanted a platform that’s **fast, secure, and universally accessible**. Telegram met all three criteria — offering both **speed** and **simplicity**.

### Advantages of Telegram Integration

- 🕐 **Instant Delivery:** Messages arrive faster than email or SMS.  
- 🔒 **Secure Communication:** End-to-end encrypted chats keep alerts private.  
- 🌍 **Multi-Device Support:** Merchants can receive alerts on desktop or mobile.  
- 🤖 **Bot Automation:** Using the Telegram Bot API, we automated alerts for every event type.

With Telegram, our merchants get direct, personal notifications — no complex dashboards required.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Here’s a simplified view of our real-time notification architecture:

1. **Event Triggers:** When a wallet balance changes, a payment fails, or a downtime event is detected.  
2. **Alert Service:** The backend pushes event data into a message queue (BullMQ).  
3. **Telegram Bot Service:** Processes the event and sends formatted messages to the merchant’s chat.  
4. **Merchant Receives Notification:** Instantly — no refresh, no delay.

### Example Notification Message

```
🚨 LOW WALLET BALANCE ALERT 🚨

Merchant: PayPro Pvt Ltd
Current Balance: ₹3,254
Threshold: ₹5,000

Please top-up your wallet to avoid payment disruption.
```

## 🧠 Types of Merchant Notifications

We categorize notifications into **four key types** for clarity and actionability:

### 1. 💰 Low Wallet Balance
Triggered when the wallet falls below a threshold.  
**Goal:** Prevent failed transactions.

### 2. ❌ Payment Failures
Sent when a transaction fails at the acquirer or PSP level.  
**Goal:** Enable faster troubleshooting.

### 3. 📊 Success Rate Drop
Tracks changes in overall success rate per acquirer channel.  
**Goal:** Detect performance issues early.

### 4. 🔴 Server Downtime Alerts
Triggered by heartbeat monitors when servers or APIs go down.  
**Goal:** Immediate visibility into infrastructure problems.

## 🔧 Best Practices for Notification Systems

From experience, here’s what makes a notification system truly reliable:

- 🎯 **Segmentation:** Send alerts only to relevant merchant groups.  
- ⚡ **Prioritization:** Highlight critical issues like failed payouts.  
- 📬 **Consistency:** Use uniform templates and emojis for readability.  
- 🔁 **Reliability:** Implement retries and backoff in case of Telegram API delays.  
- 🔐 **Security:** Secure API tokens and avoid hardcoding credentials.  

By combining these with clear design and event-based triggers, we created a **lightweight yet robust** real-time alerting engine.

## 📈 Outcome

Since deployment, Telegram notifications have significantly improved our merchant operations:

- 87% reduction in downtime response time.  
- 65% faster wallet top-ups after low balance alerts.  
- Near-zero missed payment failure acknowledgments.

Real-time visibility not only improves reliability but builds merchant trust — a core principle for us at **Protize**.
